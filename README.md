# Endless-runner-STM32F4
I have built an endless runner type game for STM32F4-Discovery microcontroller.
You can find my code in the main.c file.
If you want to use the whole project made in STMCubeIDE, there is projekt.zip file which contains all project files.
I hope you will find it interesting.
